# Connect4_Game
Developed a Connect4 game with a graphical interface using Python (Tkinter, NumPy). The game allows two players to alternately drop pieces on a 6x7 grid until one player achieves four consecutive pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
<br>
Key Highlights:
<br>
Designed a game board UI using Tkinter for smooth and interactive gameplay.
<br>
Implemented core game logic (piece dropping, turn-based system, and win condition checks).
<br>
Added real-time winner detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal sequences.
<br>
Enabled game reset functionality for multiple rounds.
<br>
Strengthened skills in Python programming, GUI development, and problem-solving.
<br>
Technologies Used: Python, Tkinter, NumPy
